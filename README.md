# Overview
　　This project is to translate Java project into tesnors which can be handled by [deep learning model](https://github.com/GrowingCode/FrameTokenMemAtten). This project is an Eclipse plugin project but to run this project is very simple. 

# Preparations before running this data preprocessing project
　　We need to set up the Java files (contain training/validating/testing files) to the specific directory at first. Please refer to [CodeCorpus](https://github.com/GrowingCode/CodeCorpus) project to finish this step. 
After the Java files are set up. This project is responsible for spliting those files into training/validating/testing files and translating the files into tensors for [deep learning model](https://github.com/GrowingCode/FrameTokenMemAtten). 

# Steps to finish data preprocessing
## Step1 
Please download Eclipse version: `Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers`. 

## Step2 
Download and load this project into Eclipse. 

## Step3 
Click this project in Eclipse package explorer and right click, choose `Run As` => `Eclipse Application`. 

## Step4
